# ANN (Artificial Neural Network) project for Unity 5

A simple project of ANN with UI made in Unity which solves the problem of XOR operation (the simpliest thing, but good for a code training and studying how artificial neural networks work).

**How to run:** create new Unity project and import files from repository. Included scene should be working.
